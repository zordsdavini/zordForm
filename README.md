Installation
------------

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the `zordform` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the 'ZordForms' menu item in your admin sidebar

Shortcodes have been re-implemented. They are used like so: [zord_form_display_field id=3 field=input1] where 3 is the ID number of the form you want to display and input1 is field name.
